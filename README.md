# abs-lang-npp
A simple Notepad++ user defined language file for [ABS](https://www.abs-lang.org/) programming language syntax to be used with default style.

## Overview

This project provides a very simple user defined language file for [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) that does some basic syntax highlighting for ABS scripts. 

## Usage

Installation instructions (taken from Notepad++ [site](http://docs.notepad-plus-plus.org/index.php?title=User_Defined_Language_Files)):

To add syntax colouring from one of these, the simplest way is o open the User Defined Language panel, click **Import** and navigate to the desired file. If you wish to proceed manually, here is how:

1. Unpack to an **.xml** file, if zipped;
2. If you don't have an **userDefineLang.xml** file already, you can drop this file among your other configuration file, in the Notepad++ Install Folder. It should be named **userDefineLang.xml**. It was reported that "creating the XML file in *C:\Program Files (x86)\Notepad++* on 64-bit Windows 7 didnâ€™t add the syntax highlighting to notepad++. I had to move the XML file to *<user>\AppData\Roaming\Notepad++* for it to work."
3. Otherwise, open both the existing and new file.
  1. Select all of the new file, copy, and paste at the end of the current file.
  2. This will have created a spurious *</Notepad_Plus><Notepad_plus>* pair i the middle, each tag on a line by itself. Remove these two consecutive lines.
  3. Close Notepad++.
  
Your Languages menu will show the newly added language at the bottom, next time you launch Notepad++.
